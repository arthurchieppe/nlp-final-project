In this video, you’ll learn how to harness the power of SpaCy’s pre-trained embeddings to build a deep learning pipeline for sentiment classification!

We’ll start by diving into what SpaCy is, its capabilities (like tokenization, named entity recognition, and lemmatization), and how it simplifies NLP workflows. Then, we’ll guide you step-by-step through a practical example using a Jupyter Notebook, where we preprocess text, extract embeddings, and train a simple neural network using PyTorch.

By the end, you’ll understand:
* How SpaCy embeddings work and their different sizes.
* Why we use techniques like mean pooling for embedding aggregation.
* How to implement and train a PyTorch model with binary cross-entropy and Adam optimizer.

Whether you’re new to NLP or looking to integrate SpaCy with deep learning, this tutorial is packed with actionable insights to get you started!

Unfortunately, the link to the Jupyter Notebook couldn’t be included in the YouTube description, as YouTube requires facial verification to add hyperlinks, and the approval process takes some time.
